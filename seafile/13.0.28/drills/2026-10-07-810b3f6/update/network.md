# Network: @update seafile

Server capture: on, from `local`. 13 of 13 app containers showed their control lookup and connection.
Browser capture: on.

The server capture records every DNS lookup an app container makes and every connection it opens to a public address; the browser capture records every request to a host outside the suite. Neither decrypts traffic, and both see only what this run made the apps do.

## Problems

None.
